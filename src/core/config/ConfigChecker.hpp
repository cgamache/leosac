/**
 * This class is here to help check the validity of the configuration.
 *
 * Leosac configuration being text-based, various object (LED, Reader, GPIO)
 * are referenced by name. This is practical because it gives the configuration
 * maintainer some flexibility (especially regarding the Doorman module).
 * However, it is also difficult to detect misconfiguration before running
 * into trouble at runtime.
 *
 * How does this class help?
 *
 * The idea is for module declaring object to register them with this class, and
 * for module using (aka talking-to) objects, to check here first.
 *
 * As a result, this class shall be fully thread safe.
 *
 * @note The current behavior is to assert when registering an object twice.
